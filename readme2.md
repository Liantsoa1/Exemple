# LEVEL 00:
To reach the solution, here were the steps:
- I went to /home/level using the command `cd`.
- I used `cd` to go to the directory called "00_welcome."
- Inside that directory, there was a file named "README.md," and I read it using `cat`.
- It said that the solution to level 0 is: "bitwarrior" without the quotes.

# LEVEL 01:
In the /home/level directory, I went to "01_choice_tree."
- Inside it, there were three directories: "blue," "green," "red," and a file called README.md (that contained nothing important).
- Within the "blue" directory, there was another one called "hats."
- Inside "hats," there were also three directories: "black," "grey," "white."
- The solution was inside the "patience" directory that was inside "solution" that was also inside the "grey" directory.
- The patience directory contained the "SOLUTION.txt," which said: The solution to level 1 is "patience" without the quotes.

# LEVEL 02:
In the /home/level directory, I went inside the "02" directory.
- I used "ls -a" to show a hidden directory called ".porb."
- Inside ".porb," I also used "ls -a" to show a file called ".solution."
- By using "cat," I saw the content of the file, and it said: The solution is HiddenIsConfig.

# LEVEL 03:
In the /home/level directory, I went inside the "03" directory.
- Using "ls -a," I saw the hidden file called ".bash_history."
- The content of the hidden file was: The solution to SSH3 is: RepeatingHistory.
